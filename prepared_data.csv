Ophelia,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ophelia,"New York, NY, USA",Medication & support to beat opioid addiction from home,https://ophelia.com,"Ophelia helps people quit opioids without going to rehab. We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Zack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors.",2019.0,28.0,https://www.linkedin.com/company/opheliahealth/,https://twitter.com/meetophelia,https://www.facebook.com/opheliahealth,,"Mattan Griffel

This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.

Mighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.

That's why we've come up with an alternative to the rent-or-own dilemma, offering the benefits of homeownership with the flexibility of renting. Here's how it works:

1. ZeroDown buys your home

This maritime environment allows us to halve the decade-long development cycle for aircraft and eVTOLs.  By operating within a wingspan of the water, seagliders have double the range of electric aircraft thanks to aerodynamic and operational efficiencies.  

Unlike conventional aircraft configurations, our first seaglider will be capable of 180 miles at 180 mph with existing battery technology. Beginning in 2025, our seagliders will commence real world operations, build consumer trust, and generate revenue while our aircraft-building competitors are still embroiled in regulatory and technical challenges. In the future, when those challenges have been overcome, REGENT will transition seagliders to the air and grow upon years of commercial success.

In the last 3 months we have closed $250M in LOIs from airlines and ferry companies. They have been so eager to switch to REGENT because our vehicle is half as expensive as an airplane and six times faster than ferries.

Legacy (YC S19) is a Series B startup focused on the fast-growing field of fertility and family planning. Founded at Harvard, the company has now raised almost $50M from leading investors like FirstMark Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Section 32, Tribe Capital, and even celebrities like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and others. For context, we've closed 4 venture rounds in 2.5 years, in addition to our celebrity round of funding. 

**What we're doing**

We are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers/parents. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

**Why are we the leader?** 

The company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:

1. Insurance (We cover over 10M individuals through insurance in NY and CA)
2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs & other SpecOps through exclusive programs)
3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers like Progyny, Carrot, and Maven)

**Tell me about the team** 

We're a team of under 50, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.
Whether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps.

Coincidentally, we started Lawdingo to answer just that. 

If you're looking for a lawyer, we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. 

We also encourage you not to take our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch.

Eventual,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/eventual,"San Francisco, CA, USA",Data Warehouse for Computer Vision,https://www.eventualcomputing.com,"Eventual is a data warehouse for images and video.

We make it easier for enterprise machine learning teams to design continuous pipelines that ingest, organize, and process imaging data. 

For example, you could use Eventual to build visual analytics by processing video feeds in the cloud from data uploaded from a manufacturing assembly line.

Although there’s plenty of data warehouses for unstructured text/tabular data, there’s not a turn-key one for imaging and videos. Currently users jerry-rig one together with multiple vendors or hard to manage open-source frameworks. We are a one-stop shop. 

1.  Query Interface: SQL works great for tabular analytics, but is a poor fit for running queries and transformations on imaging data. On Eventual, the interface is a Lambda function that can be written in your language of choice or even bash! These functions can then be run locally or on the cloud in both a standalone or pipeline fashion.

2. Shared Data Architecture: Data is stored in your own cloud storage using open formats such as Parquet. Eventual provides out-of-the-box integrations with your current storage providers such as AWS S3, PostgreSQL and more.

3. Intelligent Scheduling: Our scheduling engine takes into account resource availability, data transfer costs and predictive metrics to optimize your workloads, saving you time and money. This is especially the case with costly instances and hardware accelerators like GPUs.

Olympian Motors is a new, disruptive automaker, building the most aesthetic, minimalistic, and software-defined Electric Vehicles.

•  Received 157 pre-orders for Olympian Model O1  ($15M+ pre-booked revenue)
•  Radically minimalistic cockpit and 'data-privacy-first' architecture powered by Olympian Operating System (OOS)
•  Rapid go-to-market: We have secured key partnerships to deliver the first Olympian O1 EVs  to customers by November 2022. (It took 9+ years for Lucid and 11+ years for Rivian to make their first commercial shipment).
•  Olympian has a unique fully 'fabless' production model in the U.S., running an asset-light operation with no CAPEX or no front R&D - unlike other conventional EV companies in the U.S.
•  We disrupt today’s commoditized car experience, elevate low quality/comfort standards, simplify over-complicated cockpit/UX, and create a new ‘experience-first’ consumer segment in the automotive.


We prioritize:
- Aesthetics over horsepower
- User experience over torque
- Classiness over top-speed
- Data privacy or data exchange
- Edge computing over cloud computing
- Minimalism over 30+ buttons and switches in the cockpit
- AR HUD over 2D Display screens
- Wood, steel and titanium materials over cheap plastic and veneer
- Sustainable & natural materials over toxic chemicals


We are creating the next big story in automotive.

With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions.",2020.0,6.0,https://www.linkedin.com/company/fogbender,https://twitter.com/fogbender,,,"Andrei Soroker

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

With Telematica, companies can access telematics, battery, and other mobility data as well as remotely control EV charging with a single standardized API. 

Globally, the electric vehicle market is exploding. Particularly in India, where more than 40% of the new automobile sales are expected to be electric by 2030!

The thing that fascinates us is that virtually 100% of them are connected to the cloud, which captures and stores telematics, battery, and other mobility data. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for companies to interact with them as there is no user-friendly API or developer portal provided by any brand. For all of these vehicles, we create a single, standardized API.

Here are some immediate use cases we are powering:
1. Smart route planning, to reduce range anxiety and save money by optimizing battery usage for EV owners. 
2. Insurance companies use our telematics data to reward good drivers and also to assess battery degradation. 
3. Finally, fleets are electrifying, necessitating centralized and remote monitoring. Our API enables this transition by providing a unified interface for all vehicles irrespective of brand.

To sum up, the world is going electric and our API is going to power them all! 🚀

JumpWire,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/jumpwire,"Boston, MA, USA",Data security for every API and database,https://jumpwire.ai,"JumpWire is a software platform for enforcing data security between APIs, applications and databases. By referencing data schemas, JumpWire labels select properties inside data payloads and transforms the raw data into a protected format, using encryption, tokenization or masking. JumpWire’s approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.

JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself. Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data.",2021.0,2.0,https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumpwire,https://twitter.com/jumpwire_ai,,,"Ryan Cooke

😫 The problem 

For 30 million online tutors worldwide, the #1 pain point is: Students’ Zoom boredom.
Because a bored student is a customer who won’t stay long.

😎 The solution

We built a gamified platform for online tutors to teach kids online.

80,000 classes later, it’s clear that kids love this metaverse and beg their parents for more classes. This translates into higher retention and more business for tutors who use Koala instead of Zoom.

💰 Monetization

With a premium subscription, tutors unlock additional tools to grow their business.
And when parents pay tutors through our platform, we take 5%.

📈 Market

In 2021, parents paid $166B to online tutors.

A startup in exactly our space, Outschool, is worth $3B, 5 years after YC. 


In 10 years, every live online class will happen in Koala.

We are growing quickly because Brandon created Blitz.js, an open-source Javascript framework with 11,000 Github Stars, and Flightcontrol is a solution to the problems Blitz users were experiencing. Brandon and Mina both have engineering degrees, and are building Flightcontrol to solve those same problems we personally experienced as consultants.

We discovered AWS is built for low-level developers who want maximum performance and control, and Heroku was built as an easy solution for developers who didn’t need that control. 15 years later, there’s now a large segment of developers who do want maximum performance and control but without the difficulty of AWS.

Flightcontrol solves this by providing a layer on top of AWS that makes it very easy to use and let’s them pop the hood leverage the raw power of AWS. Because of this new approach, users have migrated their production apps to Flightcontrol from Heroku, Render, Vercel, and existing AWS setups they previously spent weeks building.

Existing SaaS solutions like LaunchDarkly require a company to send all of their data to them. This results in high costs, data compliance issues, and vendor lock-in.  As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.

We believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.  GrowthBook is well positioned to be a leader in this growing market.",2020.0,2.0,https://www.linkedin.com/company/growthbook/,https://twitter.com/growth_book,,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/growth-book,"Jeremy Dorn

By saving in USD or digital dollars, and spending as they go in local currencies, they won't be subject to inflation.

Problem:
East Africa is home to 500 million people, with a median age of 18, growing at ~3% annually. Favourable demographics and population growth, compounded with GDP growth of ~6 - 8% underpin a fast-growing middle class.

Nonetheless, East African currencies depreciate 15 - 20% per annum on average - this is the biggest impediment to wealth protection and creation for this middle class.

Solution:
We offer the middle class access to high-APY savings in stable currencies and financial services that enable consumers to spend as they go in local currencies. We do this using both banking infrastructure and Web3.

Motivation:
Being from countries with volatile currencies, we have seen family and friends lose large portions of their savings to inflation - this is what fuels our passion about this problem and what motivates us to build Bloom.",2021.0,13.0,https://www.linkedin.com/company/withbloom,https://twitter.com/BloomAppSD,https://www.facebook.com/BloomAppSD,,"Abdigani Diriye

Professional recruiters can now monetize the excess candidate inventory created from their primary business. This is work they've already done but previously couldn't benefit from. Likewise, candidates won't have to start the vetting process over from scratch again and again since they'll be able to be referred with context and get warm intros into hot hiring companies that can be hard to access.

Pandai,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/pandai,"Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Learning app for school students in Southeast Asia,https://www.pandai.org,"💡 What is Pandai?

Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. 

Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.

🔥 Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

👨‍🏫 Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

🚀 Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries.

Nasdisc,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nasdisc,"San Francisco, CA, USA","A marketplace for vinyl, cassettes and cds",https://www.nasdisc.com,"Nasdisc is a marketplace for the $4B worth of records purchased every year.

The vinyl market has seen exponential growth in the past decade - the first 6 months of this year has already seen an increase of 108% in sales. Our platform takes a 12% cut, making this a $400mm opportunity that is more than doubling every year.

Pressing plants are backed up years out, bots buy limited releases in seconds, and record prices are skyrocketing in both retail and aftermarket sales. Despite this growth, the only dedicated marketplace is difficult to use, doesn’t process transactions, yet facilitates over $600mm in vinyl exchanges per year. 

This is why I finally decided to quit my job at Google and recruit my best friends from college to fix it. We’re all software engineers and have been passionate about music and vinyl since we were kids, and have $50k in records ourselves.

We started building a marketplace in July and launched our website 4 weeks ago. We now have $1k / week in sales, and $50k in listings.",2021.0,3.0,,,,,"Simeon Goolsby

Our app captures all the relevant information you consume - text, audio, video and summarizes it 1-click. It also makes it easy to search and retrieve the information you want, wherever you like.

All co-founders know each other since 2019 and met at a one-year AI fellowship. Since their time at the fellowship, they have felt frustrated creating their second brain while shifting between apps like Roam Research, and Obsidian. These applications were burdening them to do all three tasks of capturing, organizing, and retrieving, making the cost to value ratio of setting up the second brain really high. They decided to solve this and want to shift the burden of these steps on to software, making it easier for a user to build their second brain. 

Synth is targeting 30 million knowledge workers, who earn more than $100k, paying us $20 per month, presenting a $7.2billion market opportunity. ",2021.0,3.0,https://www.linkedin.com/company/synth-ai-labs,https://twitter.com/Synth_HQ,,,"Suneel Matham
